# Development Status

## Verified in a Studio playtest (2026-11-05, synced via Rojo)
- The server and client boot with no script errors. The town and restaurant generate (about 1,070 parts, 32 active stations at level 1).
- **Full pizza loop**: dough bin → board → tomato sauce → mozzarella (→ tomato) → pick up → oven (cook %, READY, then BURNT if left) → take out → box → serve. All work, and the bin throws away a burnt pizza.
- **Customers**: the OPEN sign spawns customers, who walk in and queue ("Ready to order"). The register opens the POS. A wrong order is rejected, the correct one becomes Order #1, both items are served at pick-up, and the customer pays ($17 plus a $3.53 tip) and leaves. XP is awarded.
- **Supplies**: ordering validates level locks and storage capacity. The delivery arrives at the back-door pallet after 12 s, and boxes are carried into the fridge and dry storage.
- **Upgrades**: the level lock is enforced server-side.
- The HUD and menu boards work. Lighting is no longer overexposed.
- In a published place without Studio API access, DataStore now fails fast to a temporary profile (no 30 s retry delay).

## Not yet verified end-to-end
- Kebab station + fryer + drinks fountain + heat shelf (code paths shared with the tested pizza ones)
- Buying an upgrade and its visible model swapping (needs level 2+)
- Cleaning (rubbish, messy counters), angry walk-outs, the level-up popup, the office-PC UI
- Real DataStore saving (enable **Game Settings → Security → Enable Studio Access to API Services**, then rejoin)

## Known issues / gaps
- Roblox only shows a prompt when its part is on screen, so players must look at what they interact with (that's intended).
- Back rooms (storage, office, staff) show exterior brick on the inside walls. They need interior wall panels.
- `Lighting.Technology` must be set to **Future** by hand (scripts can't set it).
- No sound ids yet: `SoundIds.luau` is all empty, so the game is silent.
- Other players can see (but not use) prompts in your restaurant. The server rejects their use, but the client still draws the panel.
- NPCs walk straight lines between nodes (no pathfinding), so layout changes must keep the paths clear.
- No custom Blender meshes yet. All visuals are procedural parts.
- No day/shift cycle, challenges/daily goals, staff, or delivery orders yet (see TASKS.md).
